# evalRS-KDD-2023
Official Repository for EvalRS @ KDD 2023: a Rounded Evaluation of Recommender Systems

## Overview

EvalRS 2023 will be held at [KDD 2023](https://kdd.org/kdd2023/), August 7th (Long Beach, CA). 

Following the success of the [first edition](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00606-0), the workshop is back with the same focus on [rounded evaluation of recommender systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05772) (fairness, robustness and trustworthyness), but with a new, expanded format.

For the first time, the event will mix a traditional paper track and an open-source _hackaton_, inspiring participants to "live and breath" the evaluation challenges with working code. Following our tradition, we will run the entire workshop in the open, and give back to the community all the artifacts produced for the event.

Thanks to our sponsors, we will award monetary prizes for innovative papers, student contributions and best projects.

Check back soon this repo and the official website for keynote speakers and final logistics details: if you have questions about paper submission or partecipation during KDD, send us a note at `fede a_t stanford d_o_t edu` or `jacopo d_o_t tagliabue a_t nyu d_o_t edu`.
